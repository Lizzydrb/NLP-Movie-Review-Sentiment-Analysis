If a review, for example, only has one sentence with 10 words, it is very hard to classify this review as positive as it needs at least 8 positive words. A review with less than 8 words will in this case never be classified as positive (even if the review says \"Best movie ever. This is amazing.\" The other way around, if a review is very long and contains 800 words, only 1% of those words have to get a positive polarity for the review to get a positive classification (even if the other 99% is negative). In other words, the shorter the document, the harder it is to be classified as positive and the longer the document the easier it is to be classified as positive. It is therefore a problem if we don't account for document length. The length of the document must not influence the probability of the review being classified as either positive or negative.\n",

The prior probability of class POS becomes very high (0.9), which will result in a bias towards predicting POS labels. These predictions would also be correct most of the time. Moreover, because the class NEG is very small and we skip words that don't occur in both of the classes, we skip many words when we make predictions. This leads to the conditional probability of the word being less representative of the actual distributions of the words in the classes.\n"

        "In this movie review sentiment analysis, we have performed three major analyses: a lexicon-based approach, Naïve Bayes (NB) classification and Support Vector Machines (SVM). We can immediately conclude that the NB and SVM both outperform the lexicon-based approach, that “only” has a maximum accuracy of 0.70 when taking the magnitude of sentiment into account.\n",
        "\n",
        "The results indicate that the NB and SVM models perform approximately equally well for the sentiment analysis, with accuracies of 0.835 and 0.832 respectively. Both methods use bag-of-words (BoW) features, which have its semantical limitations regarding sentence structure. However, our results indicate that none of the proposed techniques to overcome this limitation showed very high improvements of accuracy.\n",
        "\n",
        "In the NB model, we first applied stemming to make the algorithm more robust. After stemming, our classifier performed with an accuracy of 0.82. Stemming reduces different forms of a word to a common base form. With this, stemming results in a relatively small reduction in feature-space, but does not gain us any meaningful information about the sentiment of the stemmed word. This might be a reason why the classifier accuracy does not improve after stemming, but even worsens a little bit. Secondly, we applied N-grams to our NB model with Laplace smoothing. N-grams features attempts to retrain word order information of the BoW. This did improve our accuracy to 0.85 for 2-grams and 0.87 for 3-grams, but also increased the feature-space substantially.\n",
        "\n",
        "For the SVMs we applied POS disambiguation, which identifies words with their Part of Speech (POS) tags. The intuition here was that POS-tags possibly carry information about the sentiment of the word. However, as our accuracy barely improved, we can conclude that the POS-tags do not carry any sentiment information of the words. Afterwards, we discarded all closed-class words from the data, which did result in an increase of accuracy. Similar to stemming, this technique reduces the feature-space, which could explain part of the increase in accuracy. However, as mentioned in Q3.2, closed-class words do not influence the final predictions of sentiment of the reviews, so most sentiment information can still be acquired from the nouns, adjectives, and adverbs. \n",
        "\n",
        "Overall, we can conclude that primarily the words themselves capture meaningful sentiment information. For example, the word “amazing” would in most cases imply a positive sentiment. The attempts to improve accuracy by adding sentence structure thus barely improved the model accuracy.\n"
